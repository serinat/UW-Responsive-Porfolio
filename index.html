                      <p>Hi, there! My name is Serina Tsang, and welcome to my portfolio site! I am currently enrolled at the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp, and what you see here is my first project built through the knowledge and skills obtained during the first few weeks of my journey!</p>   
                      <p>A little bit about myself: I graduated from the University of Washington with a BS in Chemistry and have worked over 20 years as a research scientist in the UW Comparative Medicine department. Several years ago I had taken a couple coding classes but had to postpone my completion 
                       due to family circumstances. Coding is definitely not like riding a bike, you need to practice and learn everyday to keep up with technology and to become a successful developer. While I enjoy the flexibility of my current research scientist job, my ultimate goal is to pivot out of 
                       academia and apply my passion for technology in a more relevant, challenging, team-oriented and prosperous field. More importantly, I want to instill in my kids the necessity and value in setting higher goals and expectations for themselves, something learned a bit later than planned 
                       but now more ready than ever! Thanks for finding me!!</p>
