      <p>Hi, there! My name is Serina Tsang, and welcome to my portfolio site! I am currently enrolled at the University of Washington Coding Bootcamp, and what you see here is my first project built through the knowledge and skills obtained during the first week and a half of my journey! </p>  
      
      <p>A little bit about myself: I graduated from the University of Washington with a BS in Chemistry and have worked over 20 years as a research scientist in the UW Comparative Medicine department. Several years ago I had taken a couple coding classes but had to postpone my completion 
        due to family circumstances. Coding is definitely not like riding a bike, you need to practice and learn everyday to keep up with technology and to become a successful developer. While I enjoy the flexibility of my current research scientist job, my ultimate goal is to pivot out of 
        academia and apply my passion for technology in a more relevant, challenging, team-oriented and prosperous field. More importantly, I want to instill in my kids the necessity and value in setting higher goals and expectations for themselves, something learned a bit later than planned 
        but now more ready than ever! Thanks for finding me!!</p>
