### Responsive-Portfolio

- In this project I learned how to incorporate/apply bootstrap and media queries to easily generate, style, & streamline my portfolio from scratch, as well as make my portfolio and its contents responsive at various viewports such as xs, sm and lg. I still had to play around quite a bit with margins and padding to make my porfolio look as perfect as possible, but the bootstrap pre-built classes were a helpful starting point. I'm excited to read more bootstrap documentation and apply more classes to future projects.

- A few days ago I had to sort of start over as I didn't know homework 2 should look like homework 1's style and layout with the addition of bootstrap. Finally, after hours of re-generating a responsive, bootstrap incorporated portfolio, I was only down to a couple of issues. The first was to have my images stack evenly at smaller screen sizes. With the help of Dan, I was able to set media queries involving the height of my images to make them all consistent. Secondly, my nav wouldn't format properly (nav list elements were behind my name as opposed to floating center and under my name). With the help of Dan (again),he gave me a few hints to do this or gave me the option to incorporate a functional hamburger icon which included Javascript features. I decided to try out the hamburger icon (which I inadvertantly done before but couldn't do it again). Found out my CSS styles were conflicting with bootstrap. Dan pointed me to these potental conflicts and eventually I was able to get it!
