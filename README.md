### Responsive-Portfolio

## User Stories (MVP)

- In this project I learned how to incorporate/apply bootstrap and media queries to easily generate, style, & streamline my portfolio from scratch, as well as make my portfolio and its contents responsive at various viewports such as xs, sm and lg. I still had to play around quite a bit with margins and padding to make my porfolio look as perfect as possible, but the bootstrap pre-built classes were a helpful starting point. I'm excited to read more bootstrap documentation and apply more classes to future projects.
