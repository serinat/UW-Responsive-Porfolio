### Responsive-Portfolio

- In this project I learned how to incorporate/apply bootstrap and media queries to easily generate, style, & streamline my portfolio from scratch, as well as make my portfolio and its contents responsive at various viewports such as xs, sm and lg. I still had to play around quite a bit with margins and padding to make my porfolio look as perfect as possible, but the bootstrap pre-built classes were a helpful starting point. I'm excited to read more bootstrap documentation and apply more classes to future projects.

- A few days ago I had to sort of start over as I didn't know homework 2 should look like homework 1's style and layout with the addition of bootstrap. Finally, after hours of re-generating a responsive, bootstrap incorporated portfolio, I was only down to a couple of issues. The first was to have my images stack evenly at smaller screen sizes. With the help of our very helpful TA, Dan, I was able to set media queries involving the height of my images to make them all consistent. Secondly, my nav wouldn't format properly (nav list elements were behind my name as opposed to floating center and under my name). With the help of Dan (again), he gave me a few hints to do this and gave me the option to incorporate a functional hamburger icon which included Javascript features. I decided to try out the hamburger icon (which I inadvertantly done before but couldn't do it again) and finally got it to work. Also found out my CSS styles were conflicting with bootstrap, Dan eluted to these potental conflicts and eventually I was able to get/fix it!

### Updated portfolio (homework 8) 
- Homework 8 is included in this Repo with updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two homework assignments (Password Generator & Code Quiz). GiHub profile was also updated and repositories of project1 and two homework assignments pinned, along with link to GitHub profile on Home and Contact pages. Updated resume was also uploaded with PDF link available in Contact page. Lastly, LinkedIn was updated with link on Home and Contact pages. 

In the portfolio page I have github and deployed pages for project1 and both homework assignments. Screenshot of each project/assignment is also on the page. I chose my own color palette (white, light peach and black/grey text). I also designed/drew my own initals picture as an icon for the page (also small version located on footer). After working with materialize.css on our project, I found Bootstrap to be more elaborate and user-friendly hence the reason I stuck with it. I also used fontawesome icons and animations from animate.css.

I found this homework assignment to be pretty straight forward plus I have a lot of fun styling pages. CSS was tricky at times per usual, but I found documentation to help me out. I feel like this homework assignment is open-ended in that I could continue to work on it indefinitely from adding additional projects to incorporating more style. I look forward to building on...
